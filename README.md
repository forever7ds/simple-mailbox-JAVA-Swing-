# simple-mailbox-JAVA-Swing-
A simple mailbox created by JAVA swing. It can send, receive, check mails as long as you have give it license to have an access to your mail address. More over it can send attachment and download attachment as well. It uses java8 and eclipse to complete. And we use exe4j to provide a exe file to test.

If you want to test the programme, at first you must alter the data.txt's(in Data foleder) information to yourself's mailbox's information as the introduction in it.

We use the javax.mail and javax.activation.
